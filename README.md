# X-Clacks-Overhead plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

X-Clacks-Overhead is a non-standardised HTTP header based upon the fictional work of the late, great, Sir Terry Pratchett. This plugin enables you to add the pre-requisite 'GNU Terry Pratchett' as well as other custom X-Clacks-Overhead headers to Craft.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require adigital/x-clacks-overhead

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for X-Clacks-Overhead.

## Configuring X-Clacks-Overhead

By default, the only header included by the plugin will be 'GNU Terry Pratchett', but you can add more names to this by adding the the setting field.
