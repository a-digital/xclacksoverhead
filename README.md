# X-Clacks-Overhead plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

X-Clacks-Overhead is a non-standardised HTTP header based upon the fictional work of the late, great, Sir Terry Pratchett. This plugin enables you to add the pre-requisite 'GNU Terry Pratchett' as well as other custom X-Clacks-Overhead headers to Craft.
